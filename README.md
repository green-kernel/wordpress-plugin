# WP Sustainability Monitor


A WordPress admin plugin that visualizes the energy consumption of your WordPress installation in real time.
It reads data from the [`procpower`](https://github.com/green-kernel/procpower) kernel extension (`/proc/energy/cgroup`) and displays it in a live chart (1-second interval) directly in the WordPress dashboard.

## âœ¨ Features

- Adds a **Sustainability** menu entry in the WordPress admin area
- Reads energy usage per PID from `/proc/energy/cgroup` (via `procpower`)
- Displays a real-time line chart using [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)
- Shows tabular readings sorted by current energy use
- Includes raw `/proc/energy/cgroup` output for debugging
- Keeps data fully inside the Docker container â€” **no sensitive host data is leaked**


## âš¡ Requirements

- Linux host with [`procpower`](https://github.com/green-kernel/procpower) installed and `/proc/energy/cgroup` available
- Docker & Docker Compose
- WordPress (containerized in this setup)


## ðŸ”Ž Limitations

Due to the way Linux and Docker work, we can only show the energy usage of the container the plugin is running in. It is technically not possible to display the resource consumption of other processes.

If you are running your database somewhere else, you will need to install a logger inside this container. This is straightforward, as you can simply read the `cgroup` file available within the container.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start (Docker Compose)

Clone this repository and run WordPress with the plugin:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/wp-sustainability-monitor.git
cd wp-sustainability-monitor

docker compose up

Then you can access the demo under http://localhost:8080/
