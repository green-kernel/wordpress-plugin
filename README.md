# WP Sustainability Monitor


A WordPress admin plugin that visualizes the energy consumption of your WordPress installation in real time.
It reads data from the [`procpower`](https://github.com/green-kernel/procpower) kernel extension (`/proc/energy/cgroup`) and displays it in a live chart (1-second interval) directly in the WordPress dashboard.
